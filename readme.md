## To Run on GNU/Linux:
`./blue-log-viewer.py /var/log/apache2/error.log`

#### If you see something resembling the following:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./blue-log-viewer.py", line 3, in <module>
    from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PyQt5'
```

##### then on Debian / Ubuntu / XUbuntu / Kubuntu / KDE Neon run:
`sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5`

##### or on Fedora (Redhat RPM based) use pip3 instead:
```sudo pip3 install pyqt5```


...then try again.

I use https://brew.sh/ to get it to install - you can try pip3 etc

`python3.7 blue-log-viewer.py`

## To test
This application has some Selenium style functional tests.
You can see them by looking in `./features/runs.py` and looking at the [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/) in the comments.

They use Python's native [testing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) as a test harness for running these tests.

To run them do the following:

  1. Edit ./blue-log-viewer.py, find the line `if False` and flip it to true to enable testing (make sure you turn it back to false for production).

  2. Make sure localhost port **8032** is available

  3. run `python3 features/runs.py`

## AppImage

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/App-image-logo.svg" align="right" style="float: right; width: 200px">

This whole program can be compiled into an AppImage!
* To run the build execute: `prepair-artwork-and-create-app-image.sh` \*

* The AppImage doesn't currently have a signed key

* Nor does it have an update mechanism *yet*

* Nor does it know how to build a png icon from the svg so `./artwork/blue-log-viewer.png` is missing


\* Running the build script will use Docker to start a svg to png converter for making the icon

To bypass icon creation run `./tools/app-image-create.sh`
*(Run ./icon-svg-to-png.sh to just build the png)*
